# Setting up R and Rstudio

The objective of this course is to provide a practical dimension as a complement to the introductory course on quantitative methods by learning programming. To use these statistical methods, you will learn to code in a programming language called R and through a software called Rstudio. To get the first session off to a good start and avoid wasting too much time setting up, you will need to bring a laptop with R and Rstudio installed. This short tutorial explains how to do it. If you have any issues to install these programs correctly, **please contact me before the first class**.

R and Rstudio are two different things. R is both a programming language and a software program for coding. However, Rstudio is a much more functional interface, and that's what we're going to use it for. However, you must first install R to be able to run Rstudio.

## Install R

You can install R from [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/) (The comprehensive R Archive Network). On the site, you'll find links to download the version of R you need for your operating system (Windows, Mac or Linux). Then click to download the latest version (it should be 4.3.1) . Once the download is complete, you need to execute the installer.

## Install Rstudio

Once R is set up, you can install Rstudio. Rstudio is an IDE, you can interact with and have a lot a functionalities.

## Installing package

To make sur everything works, try to install a package by typing "install.package("tidyverse)" inside the bottom left pane and click enter. It should take a moment. But if at the end no error, you are ready to go. If you have some errors, please write me an email.
