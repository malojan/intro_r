# 2023- Introduction to R

This repository contains the course materials for the programming class of the research master's students in political science at Sciences Po. Each session has its own dedicated folder, organized as an R project, enabling students to easily download the session materials onto their laptops. The course is structured as a Quarto book, which students can also access on the [**website**](https://malo-jn.quarto.pub/introduction-to-r/).
