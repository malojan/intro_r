1.  Download and import the [Chapell Hill Expert Survey trend file](https://www.chesdata.eu/ches-europe) into Rstudio

2.  Explore the codebook to see the variables available in this dataset and choose one of your interest[^03_dataviz-1].

3.  Using graphs, provide a brief analysis of how political parties differ on this issue. You should find a way to use at least the following geoms : `geom_bar()`, `geom_point()`, `geom_boxplot()`. If you want to polish the aesthetics of your graphics, take a look at these resources.

4.  Combine both your code and your analysis in a quarto document, render it in pdf and upload it on moodle.
