## Why data visualization ?

1.  Exploration and description
2.  Communication
3.  Aesthetics

## What makes a bad visualization ?

1.  Perceptual (bad)
2.  Substantive (wrong)
3.  Aesthetics (ugly)

## Ugly charts

## Wrong charts

## Forget about pie charts (the so-called "camemberts") {.smaller}

-   One of the first graphs that comes in our mind when we think about dataviz
-   If you have already done that once, it will not happen again
-   We want to understand relative sizes but humans are bad at judging angles
-   Use barcharts instead : humans are better at judging bar lengths (William Cleveland)

## Bar charts instead of pie charts

::: {layout-nrow="2"}

## Forget about double axis

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
### 

-   Misleading
-   Difficult to read
-   Use several graphs/facets instead

## Many more caveats

-   Colors that communicates nothing
-   Cutting Y axis
-   More caveats [here](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveats.html)

# The grammar of graphics

## Plotting systems in R

-   Base R and functions such as `plot()`, `hist()`, `boxplot()`
-   `lattice` package
-   The gramar of graphics of `ggplot()`

## Visualization with ggplot() {.smaller}

-   Graphs are built by adding various layers allowing to make progressively more complex visualizations
-   Three main layers in a ggplot graph :
    -   data in a tidy format
    -   aesthetics : what are the values that we want to map on the x and y axis, with wich color/shape/size
    -   geom : the geometry allows you to specify how you want to represent your data
-   Other layers possible : facets, stats, coordinates, themes, statistics...
-   Each of those can be add with a `+`
